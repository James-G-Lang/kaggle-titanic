# kaggle-titanic  
kaggle titanic starter competition  
This repository contains a jupyter notebook file with my analysis and process for the titanic kaggle competition

'Data' folder contains the given data files from kaggle: test.csv, train.csv, and gender_submission.csv.
test.csv is the file that the chosen model must run predictions on. 
train.csv is used to train the model.
and gender_submission.csv is an example submission file provided by kaggle.
I will output my test results to a file called 'results.csv' which will be added once I have a model to test
